              <h4>Hacker Trail</h4>
              <p>
                The classic hackathon experience! Build anything cool that comes to your mind, and don’t be afraid to try new technologies. The sky is the limit, and we will have plenty of workshops with topics ranging from Web Development to Machine Learning. There will also be mentors around the clock to help you throughout the weekend, as well as many sponsor prizes up for grabs.

              <h4>Design Trail</h4>
              <p>
                Through this Trail, you will have the opportunity to submit a portfolio of your design work for the chance to participate in Bitcamp as a designer. You will act as a mentor and contributor to multiple teams at the event, while developing a portfolio of your designs (your Bitfolio) which will be judged at the end of the hackathon by design professionals.

              <p>
                The bustling world of entrepreneurship can be hard to navigate, so we want to offer you the opportunity to hear from key players in the startup space: venture capitalists and student entrepreneurs! We will have workshops geared towards taking your hack to the next level and working on a venture as a student and beyond. Participants in this trail will be able to compete for the “Best Potential Startup” prize, judged by veteran entrepreneurs!

              <p>
                Bitcamp is all about exploration and pursuing your passions, regardless of your experience level. We will have special beginner-oriented workshops and sessions to guide first-timers through both the world of coding and hacking, covering essentials such as how to form your own team, make use of mentors, and submit a project. Beginners will also be able to apply their newly developed skills to a project to compete for the “Best Scout Hack” prize.

              <h5>What is Bitcamp?</h5>
              <p>
                Bitcamp is a hackathon that values participant experience and mentorship over competitiveness and points. Come to have fun with your friends, learn something new, eat s’mores, and have a generally awesome time. We have all sorts of crazy activities planned for you...come find out the rest!
              </p>
              <h5>What’s a hackathon?</h5>
              <p>
                A hackathon is a creative marathon all about building cool things. Students are encouraged to come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in 36 hours. We want you to take something you love (sports, art, camping, anything!) and combine it with technology to make something awesome. It's a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.
              </p>
              <h5>What have past Bitcampers created?</h5>
              <p>
                From Augmented Reality Human-Scale Pong to a research paper detailing vulnerabilities in Google’s reCaptcha system, the projects at Bitcamp span across all categories and interests.

                Unfortunately, minors will not be able to register this year. However, as a part of our new Minors Programs, we will be partnering with various high schools to bring five teams of high school students to Bitcamp.

              <h5>What if I have no experience or ideas?</h5>
              <p>
                Don't be afraid if you don't think you have enough experience, a team, or an idea. Everyone has a first hackathon, and we would love for Bitcamp to be yours! Mentors who are well-versed in a variety of topics will also be there to help you, whether it be finding a team, fleshing out an idea, or just figuring out where to begin.
              </p>
              <h5>How else can I get involved?</h5>
              <p>
                We'd love to get you on our volunteering or mentoring teams! If you'd like to help, please fill out <a href="https://bitcamp.typeform.com/to/m5K1bI">this form</a>.

              </p>
              <h5>What is Devpost?</h5>

              <h5>Timing</h5>
              <p>
                Participants will arrive between 6PM and 8PM on Friday, April 6th, 2018. Our Sponsor Fair will also be at 7PM, where you can spend time going around and check out our different sponsor booths. Hacking starts Friday evening after opening ceremony. Closing ceremony will begin at 3PM on Sunday, April 8th, 2018. For a better idea of the flow of the event, check out our schedule from <a href="http://2017.bit.camp/">Bitcamp 2017</a>!
              </p>
              <h5>Location</h5>
              <p>
                We are proud to host Bitcamp at the Xfinity Center on the University of Maryland campus! This expansive sports arena is a unique spot for any event, and we’re excited to be back again!
              </p>
              <h5>Travel</h5>
              <p>
                We'll have buses covering the hike from many colleges. If there are many registered campers from one specific college, we will try to have a bus for it. We will be reimbursing any individual’s hiking expenses on a case-by-case basis. Please contact <a href="mailto:travel@bit.camp">travel@bit.camp</a> for more information.
              </p>
              <h5>Packing List</h5>
              <p>
                Bring yourself, a photo ID, your signed waiver (if applicable), a change of clothes, toiletries, a sleeping bag/blanket, your hacker setup (laptop, charger, headphones, tablet for designers), and maybe an idea or two!
              </p>
              <h5>Teams</h5>
              <p>
                Projects are submitted by teams to DevPost. You don't need to finalize your team until project submissions are due during the event. You may work individually or in a team of up to four campers. Don’t have a team in mind? No problem! Hacking will kick off with an optional team formation event.
              </p>
              <h5>Guidelines</h5>
              <p>
                Don't bring any firearms, knives, weapons, drugs, or alcohol. Don't use an old project. Start a new trail instead! Also, please read the <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">Major League Hacking Code of Conduct</a> and the <a href="./terms-code-waiver.pdf">Bitcamp Terms, Code of Conduct, and Release Waiver</a>. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody (TL;DR be nice).
              </p>
